Project Title: Marketing Campaign Performance Insights
Problem Statement:
In the highly competitive landscape of digital marketing, effectively evaluating the success of
various marketing campaigns is essential for optimizing return on investment (ROI) and
improving overall performance. Despite having extensive data on multiple campaigns, there
is a need for a thorough analysis to assess and compare key metrics such as conversion
rates, acquisition costs, and ROI across different campaign types, channels, and audience
segments. This project aims to uncover actionable insights by examining temporal trends,
geographical influences, and audience responses to identify factors driving campaign
success and provide recommendations for enhancing future marketing strategies.
